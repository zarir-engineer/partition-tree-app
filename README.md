This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

> This code creates an interactive app where you can see a "top node" with the value 66.67 and 8 child nodes below it. 
> Each child node displays a fraction value (1/8 initially). You can modify the values of the child nodes, and the app 
> will automatically adjust them so that all fractions add up to 1 (100%). Additionally, buttons "+" and "-" allow 
> users to add or remove nodes.
