This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

> If a child’s value increases → Other children decrease proportionally, unless they have been manually edited by the user. 
> If a top-level spinner’s value increases → Other top-level spinners decrease proportionally, unless edited already. 
> Changes in a top-level spinner propagate down → Adjust its children accordingly, unless the child is manually edited.
